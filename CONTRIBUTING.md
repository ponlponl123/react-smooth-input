# Contributing to smooth-input

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

We welcome all contributions, whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting a pull request.

## Development Setup

This project uses **Bun** (or npm) for package management and **tsup** for building the library. We have a playground in the `example/` folder to test components during development.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Bun (recommended, as we use `bun.lock`) or npm

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ponlponl123/react-smooth-input.git
cd react-smooth-input

# Install dependencies for the library
bun install
# or
npm install
```

### 2. Live Development Workflow

We use a "watch" mode to rebuild the library on changes, and a separate Next.js app in `example/` to test them instantly.

**Terminal 1 (Library Root):**
Run the build in watch mode. This listens for changes in `src/` and updates `dist/`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Example App):**
Navigate to the example folder, install its dependencies, and start the Next.js app.

```bash
cd example

# Install example dependencies
bun install # or npm install

# Start the playground
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your changes.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - The source code for the component library.
- `src/components/` - Exported React components (e.g., `Input.tsx`).
- `src/core/` - Internal logic and sub-components.
- `example/` - A Next.js test application consuming the local build.
- `dist/` - The compiled output (generated by tsup).

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` or `dev` for my personal development progress.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add a usage example in the `example/` folder to verify it works.
3. Ensure the build passes:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Make sure your code is formatted (Prettier is recommended).

## Styling

We use **Tailwind CSS**. If you are adding new components:

- Ensure classes are flexible (allow overrides via props if necessary).
- Keep the design "smooth" and modern consistent with the library's theme.
